# Vale-Java-Practice

The objective of this practice is to cover a basic set of Java techniques, this will include some OOP techniques and potentially some Lambda expressions.

This project may include excessive comments, this is purely as a reflection of recollection and refreshing of
each concept explored. Tasks will include more programmatic driven solutions rather than an exploration of
java techniques and keywords.
