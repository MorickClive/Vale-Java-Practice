# Vale-Java-Practice

The objective of this practice is to cover a basic set of Java techniques, this will include some OOP techniques and potentially some Lambda expressions.

This project may include excessive comments, this is purely as a reflection of recollection and refreshing of
each concept explored. Tasks will include more programmatic driven solutions rather than an exploration of
java techniques and keywords.

Checkout the [feature-branch model here!](https://github.com/MorickClive/Vale-JavaBasics-Practice/network)

The topics that'll be covered are:
- [ ] Java Basics:
	- [X] Variables
	- [X] Methods
	- [X] Arrays
	- [X] Operations (Incremental, Arithmetic, PEMDAS/BIDMAS, Modulus)
	- [X] Conditionals (if, switch-case, ternary bitwise)
	- [X] Iteration/Loop(for, for-each, while, do-while)
	- [	] Strings
	
- [ ] Object-Oriented Programming 
  - [ ] Wrapper classes
  - [ ] Object-Oriented Programming Principles:
     - [ ] Encapsulation
     - [ ] Inheritance
     - [ ] Polymorphism
     - [ ] Abstraction
   - [ ] Enumeration
   
- [ ] Advanced Java:
	- [X] Exceptions: try, try-catch, try-finally
	- [ ] File In/Out
	
- [ ] JAVA 8:
	- [ ] Streams/Lambdas
	  - [ ] map
	  - [ ] filter
	  - [ ] sorted
	  - [ ] collect
	  - [ ] forEach
	  - [ ] reduce

Additional topics may be incorporated, the repo should follow a developer-branch(also know as feature-branch)
   model.
