# Vale-JavaBasics-Practice

The objective of this practice is to cover a basic set of Java techniques, this will include some OOP techniques and potentially some Lambda expressions.

This project may include excessive comments, this is purely as a reflection of recollection and refreshing of
each concept explored. Tasks will include more programmatic driven solutions rather than an exploration of
java techniques and keywords.

The topics that'll be covered are:
- [X] Variables
- [X] Methods
- [X] Arrays
- [X] Operations (Incremental, Arithmetic, PEMDAS/BIDMAS, Modulus)
- [X] Conditionals (if, switch-case, ternary bitwise)
- [ ] Iteration/Loop(for, for-each, while, do-while)
- [ ] Exceptions: try, try-catch, try-finally
- [ ] OOP/Classes
  - [ ] Wrapper classes
  - [ ] Object-Oriented Programming Principles:
     - [ ] Encapsulation
     - [ ] Inheritance
     - [ ] Polymorphism
     - [ ] Abstraction
   - [ ] Enumeration
- [ ] Streams/Lambdas
  - [ ] map
  - [ ] filter
  - [ ] sorted
  - [ ] collect
  - [ ] forEach
  - [ ] reduce

Additional topics may be incorporated, the repo should follow a developer-branch(also know as feature-branch)
   model.
